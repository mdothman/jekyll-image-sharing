# jekyll-image-sharing
## Overview
The user experience of *100 Automations* should have a share button available for images.

The report seeks to investigate how to implement a tool for sharing images on our jekyll site.

## Obstacles
> *Since May 1st 2019, Facebook no longer accepts arbitrary preview images for pages shared from the web. Only static preview image specified in the page's meta tags will be used by facebook*

* Image sharing should somehow overcome Facebook sharing obstacles.
