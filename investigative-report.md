# Image Sharing report

## Overview
Meta tags are used by facebook page crawler. This can be used to our advantage given site structure. We want to have a carousel of images with pop-up share and download buttons. If this site wants to be constructed optimally we are going to turn those images into buttons with background preview images. 

The background image will be the image post. We will construct what will the image post look like. Given the elements that we wish to control while sharing, and the multitude of  media websites we wish to reach  those will be our content values.

For example: We want to have specific titles, tags, descriptions, etc. We can attach that to the post, and set them as meta property and content values.
